    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <h3>What Is Our Mission?</h3>
    <p>Architectural students often face challenges in effectively showcasing their projects 
        and receiving feedback. Traditional methods, such as physical portfolios or limited social 
        media presence, do not fully capture the essence of their work or have meaningful connections 
        with peers, professionals, and potential employers who are scouting out our website.</p>
  
    <h3>What Is The Issue?</h3>
    <p>There is currently a lack of a dedicated online platform where architectural students can easily
         upload, share, and showcase their projects, receive constructive feedback that is not in a 
         school setting, and connect with other students and industry professionals. Existing platforms 
         do not cater specifically to the unique needs of architecture students, such as the ability 
         to present detailed designs, integrate multimedia content, and foster a community of 
         collaboration and critique.</p>

         <h3>Who Is This For?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Architectural students seeking to build an online portfolio.</li>
            <li>Educators looking for a platform to assign projects and facilitate discussions.</li>
            <li>Industry professionals interested in scouting new talent.</li> 
        </ul>
